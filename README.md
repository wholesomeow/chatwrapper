# Chat Wrapper (name TBD)

Logos and cool gifs of it being used like all the cool repos do.

Ever had a great back-and-forth with ChatGPT and then lost track of _where_ that great idea was? Or maybe you want to explore something interesting, but didn't want to get lost in the sauce. Chats are basically unstructured projects and you need a way to clean things up.
This project is a simple CLI tool that treats conversations like code: you can **commit**, **diff**, and **merge** entire chat sessions, or **export** specific responses to a separate notes file.

Out of the box you get:

- Save chats as commits (with messages, just like git).
- Compare versions with diffs.
- Merge two conversation paths together.
- Add notes or pre-commit hooks to keep context organized.
- Export everything to markdown for writing, research, or just sanity.
