Perfect — here’s a **doc-style draft** for your **MVP Definition** section, in markdown:

# MVP Definition

This document outlines the smallest possible product that proves the value of a **chat versioning + synthesis workflow**, while providing a clear growth path from a **FOSS CLI tool** to a **SaaS platform**.

---

## CLI MVP Features

The CLI is the **core proof-of-concept** and validates demand among technical early adopters.

* **Chat Sessions**

  * Create, load, and manage chats locally.
  * "Pre-commit" style hooks for injecting personality into assistant at conversation inception.
  * Stored in lightweight structured format (YAML or JSON).
  * Each session has unique IDs for traceability.

* **Commits**

  * Ability to “commit” chat progress with metadata:

    * Commit message (intent/summary).
    * Timestamp + hash.
    * Optional tags.

* **Diffs**

  * Line-by-line or structured diff between chat states.
  * Useful for tracking reasoning changes over time.

* **Merges**

  * Combine two or more chats into a new branch.
  * Requires commit-style “merge message” to inject user intent.
  * Supports cherry-picking specific exchanges.

* **Pre-Commit Hooks**

  * Configurable YAML hooks for automated checks:

    * Enforce commit messages.
    * Run linting (e.g. “summaries required”).
    * AI-powered summaries (optional, if connected).

* **Export**

  * Notes/chats exportable to Markdown.
  * Markdown is portable to Obsidian, Notion, GitHub wikis.

## Success Criteria

The MVP is validated when:

* Developers/researchers use the CLI to manage sessions.
* Early adopters request collaboration + sync.
* UX proof (TUI/Electron) shows demand beyond hardcore CLI users.
* SaaS MVP gains paying subscribers (small but real).
