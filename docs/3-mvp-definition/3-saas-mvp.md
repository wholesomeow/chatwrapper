# SaaS MVP (Phase 2)

Once core workflows are validated locally, expand into SaaS.

- **Authentication**

  - Email + OAuth sign-in.
  - Basic identity for cloud storage.

- **Sync**

  - Cloud sync of chat sessions + commits.
  - Option for selective sync (not all sessions).

- **Vault Explorer (Web UI)**

  - Web-based interface to browse commits, diffs, merges.
  - Like “Obsidian meets GitHub meets ChatGPT sidebar.”
  - Search + filter across merged sessions.

- **Workspaces**

  - Multiple projects/spaces for different teams/research topics.
  - Permissions (owner, editor, viewer).

- **Basic Billing**

  - Stripe integration.
  - Free tier = local + limited sync.
  - Paid tiers unlock advanced sync, collaboration, storage.
