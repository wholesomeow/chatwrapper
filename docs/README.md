# Chat Wrapper Documents

Here are all the documents that have been generated during the development of Chat Wrapper (final name TBD). This serves as the landing page for people looking to understand the product more.

General gameplan is to focus on creating documents that help build the initial toolset, then build the actual toolset. Documents for later use (like Operations Docs) exist as a placeholder to be filled out later on; a stepping stone that is outlined, but doesn't need to be placed yet. Some documents (like Monetization and Feature Evolution) exist to serve as a guiding point to ensure that what is being built will be built with long-term goals in mind and can exist loosely or as stubs.

## Table of Contents

- [MVP Definition](#3-mvp-definition)
- [Feature Evolution Roadmap](#4-feature-evolution-roadmap)

- [Community & Growth Docs](#8-community--growth-docs)

## 1. **Foundational Documents**

These define the _core vision_ and should keep scope tight.

- [**Vision & Mission Statement**](./1-foundational-docs/1-vision-and-mission-statement.md)

  - What problem are we solving?
  - Who are the target users?

- [**Feature Set (Initial + Long-Term)**](./1-foundational-docs/2-feature-set.md)

  - Core FOSS: chat versioning, merges, commits.
  - UX Features: pre-commit hooks, baked-in notes.
  - SaaS Additions: cloud sync, real-time collab, workspace mgmt.

## 2. **Architecture & System Design Docs**

These documents should define the _technical_ implementation, challenges and solutions in creating and deploying the product.

- **Block Diagram**

  - Core components: CLI, local store, sync layer, SaaS backend, UI frontend.

- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**

  - How chats, commits, notes, and merges move through the system.
  - Where pre-commit hooks inject context.

- **Storage Strategy**

  - Local (SQLite, file system, Obsidian-like markdown vaults).
  - SaaS (Postgres, S3, encrypted doc store).

- **Security Model**

  - Auth (FOSS: local keys, SaaS: OAuth + JWT).
  - Privacy (user owns data, encrypted at rest).

## 3. **MVP Definition**

The smallest possible product that still proves the concept.

- [**CLI MVP Features**](./3-mvp-definition/1-cli-mvp-features.md)

  - Chat sessions, commits, diffs, merges.
  - Pre-commit hooks (configurable YAML).
  - Notes export → markdown.

- [**UX Proof-of-Concept**](./3-mvp-definition/2-ux-proof-of-concept.md)

  - Minimal TUI (like `lazygit`) OR simple Electron wrapper.

- [**SaaS MVP (Phase 2)**](./3-mvp-definition/3-saas-mvp.md)

  - Auth, sync, web-based vault explorer (like Obsidian meets ChatGPT sidebar).
  - User workspaces, basic billing.

## 4. **Feature Evolution Roadmap**

How you go from CLI → SaaS.

1. **FOSS CLI** (local only, no accounts).
2. **Hybrid Desktop App** (Obsidian-like vault + ChatGPT-like chats).
3. **Cloud Sync SaaS** (team workspaces, sharing, real-time merges).
4. **Premium Features**

   - AI-powered merge suggestions.
   - AI-assisted “note condensation” (Obsidian-style summaries).
   - Multi-user chat versioning (collab).

## 5. **Monetization Strategy Docs**

- [**Free vs Paid**](./5-monetization-strategy-docs/1-free-vs-paid.md)

  - Free: local-only CLI, self-hosting.
  - Paid: sync, collab, advanced AI features.

- [**Pricing Model**](./5-monetization-strategy-docs/2-pricing-model.md)

  - Indie/Student tier (\~\$5–10/mo).
  - Pro tier (\~\$15–25/mo).
  - Team tier (\~\$30–50/mo/user).

- [**Differentiators**](./5-monetization-strategy-docs/3-differentiators.md)

  - FOSS trust base (like GitLab → GitLab SaaS).
  - Merges + notes = research/collaboration killer feature.

## 6. **UI/UX Design Docs**

This is where your Obsidian + ChatGPT hybrid concept shines.

- **UI Mockups**

  - **Left Sidebar 1**: Chats (like ChatGPT).
  - **Left Sidebar 2**: Notes & Folders (like Obsidian).
  - **Main Window**: Tabs for chats, notes, diffs, merges.

- **Interaction Flows**

  - Start chat → auto-pre-commit hook injects intent.
  - During chat → user exports chunks → notes sidebar auto-updates.
  - Merge two chats → system prompts user for a “merge commit message” (intent injection).

## 7. **Operations Docs**

For SaaS scaling later.

- **DevOps/Deployment Plan**

  - Self-host (Docker Compose).
  - SaaS (K8s, Postgres, S3).

- **Logging & Observability**

  - Track merges, hook usage, note creation.

- **Scaling Strategy**

  - From indie tool → research teams → enterprise.

## 8. **Community & Growth Docs**

- **Open Source Governance**

  - FOSS CLI repo, MIT/Apache license.

- **Community Contributions**

  - Plugin system (e.g. custom pre-commit hooks).

- **Growth Funnel**

  - Free FOSS → Desktop app → SaaS upgrade.
