# Vision & Mission Statement

## Problem Definition

Modern chat interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) lack the ability to:

- **Version conversations**: branching, committing, and merging are not supported, leaving users stuck in linear or fragmented histories.
- **Preserve synthesis and intent**: merging or restructuring conversations into coherent narratives is manual and error-prone.
- **Support reproducible workflows**: researchers and developers cannot easily backtrack, replay, or remix prior states.
- **Maintain cohesion**: assistant drift ruins the collaboration flow, and getting back to that state is frustrating and takes time.
- **Integrate with note-taking**: exporting structured insights into knowledge systems (Obsidian, Notion, markdown vaults) requires hacks or copy/paste.

This creates friction for **power users** (developers, researchers, technical writers) who require structured exploration and collaboration in their workflows.

Tangents and branching thoughts are fundamental to natual conversations, but are not easily supported by modern chat interfaces. They require the user to keep that context in their mind while attempting to explore another thought; This holds back exploration and discovery. By creating tools that emulate well-known version control features, this friction is fully removed, allowing researchers and developers to work at the speed of their own minds.

## Mission

Our mission is to build a **chat-native version control system** that combines the rigor of Git with the flexibility of modern knowledge management.

We aim to enable:

- **Branching & synthesis**: Explore divergent conversation paths and merge them back into coherent artifacts.
- **Embedded intent**: Encode user goals, tone, or research framing directly into the conversation structure.
- **Exportability**: Allow insights and notes to flow seamlessly into personal or team knowledge bases.
- **Collaboration at scale**: Create a foundation where teams can work on shared “conversation workspaces,” much like they collaborate on code today.

## Target Users

- **Power Users (Initial Focus)**
  Developers, researchers, and knowledge workers comfortable with CLI workflows and Git-style commands.

- **Writers & Analysts**
  Users who need structured synthesis and repeatable idea development.

- **Teams (Future SaaS Phase)**
  Organizations needing collaborative, cloud-synced conversation workspaces, with roles, permissions, and shared templates.
